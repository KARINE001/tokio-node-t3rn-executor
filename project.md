# T3rn — A New Standard for Secure Cross-Chain Execution

**T3rn** is building the future of cross-chain interoperability.  
It provides a **trust-minimized execution layer** that allows smart contracts to perform secure, programmable actions across multiple blockchains.

## Vision: Programmable Interoperability

Most blockchains are siloed — isolated systems with limited cross-chain capabilities.  
T3rn changes this by introducing a **modular protocol** that connects chains through a **reversible and verifiable execution model**.

Its mission:  
> Create a universal standard for cross-chain transactions that are **trustless, atomic, and auditable**.

## The Role of Executor Nodes

Executor nodes are the **backbone of T3rn's multichain execution engine**.  
They:
- Listen for execution instructions emitted from the T3rn network
- Execute them on external blockchains (like Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, etc.)
- Return signed execution proofs, ensuring finality and auditability

These nodes act as **bridges with logic**, not just data.

## Why Run a T3rn Executor Node?

Participating as an executor:
- Supports **interoperable DeFi** and multichain apps
- Positions you as an early actor in a novel crypto primitive
- Prepares you for **potential rewards** during testnet and mainnet rollout
- Contributes to the decentralization and robustness of the T3rn network

This node isn't just a relayer — it's part of a **smart, cross-chain operating system**.
